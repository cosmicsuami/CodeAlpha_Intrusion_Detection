# Network Intrusion Detection System  

This project involves the development of a **Network-Based Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)**, designed to monitor and analyze network traffic for suspicious activities. The system is configured to detect potential threats using **Suricata**, with custom rules and alerts for enhanced threat detection.  

---

## **Project Objectives**  
- **Monitor Network Traffic**: Analyze real-time network data to identify malicious activities.  
- **Custom Rules**: Create and implement detection rules tailored to specific threats.  
- **Alert System**: Configure notifications for detected intrusions.  
- **Visualization**: Optionally, display detected attacks using visualization tools for better insight.  

---

## **Features**  
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuously scans network packets for suspicious behavior.  
- **Customizable Rules**: Define rules to detect specific types of threats.  
- **Alerts**: Trigger alerts for potential intrusions to ensure quick response.  
- **Attack Visualization**: Use SQLite to visualize alerts

## **Setup Instructions**  

### Prerequisites  
- Linux-based system (preferred).  
- Suricata installed.  
- Python (for optional custom scripts or integration).  
- Visualization tools (optional): SQLite.  

### Installation  
1. **Install Suricata**:  
   Follow the official documentation to install:    
   - [Suricata Installation Guide](https://suricata.io/)  

2. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/cosmicsuami/CodeAlpha_Intrusion_Detection.git  
   cd CodeAlpha_Intrusion_Detection  
   ```  

3. **Set Up Rules**:  
   - Define your custom rules in the `rules/` directory.  
   - Add them to Suricata's configuration.  

4. **Run the IDS**:  
   - Suricata Example:  
     ```bash  
     sudo suricata -c /path/to/suricata.yaml -i eth0  
     ```  

5. **Enable Alerts**:  
   Alerts will be logged to the `logs/` directory.  

6. **Visualize Detected Attacks** (Optional):  
   Use visualization tools to analyze and display logs. Example setup for SQLite:  
   - Configure SQLite to ingest logs.  
   - Visualize data in SQLite dashboards on its web interface.  

---

## **Usage**  
- **Modify Rules**: Adjust the rules in `rules/` to match your specific network security requirements.  
- **Monitor Logs**: Regularly check the `logs/` directory for alerts.  
- **Respond to Threats**: Take action based on detected threats (e.g., block IPs, notify admins).
